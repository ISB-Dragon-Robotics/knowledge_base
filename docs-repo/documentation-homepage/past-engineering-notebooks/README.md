# Past Engineering Notebooks

Before the 2023-2024 Over Under season, practically all ISB design notebooks were created only in a physical format and were cataloged using scans or images. Notebooks created in a digital format are stored in their original form and converted into PDFs whenever possible.

Please correctly attribute ideas, designs and other content within the notebook to the respective ISB Robotics teams or its original designers. Guidance for attribution is provided under each entered notebook. While we understand that past ISB teams may not have fully cited or attributed all of their ideas to their sources, we hope that future teams from both ISB and elsewhere will try their best to do so.&#x20;
