# Robotics at ISB

At the International School of Beijing, robotics is offered as part of extracurricular activities and ISB design courses at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, taking place in the ISB MS/HS Design Center or in the ISB ES Design classrooms.&#x20;

In elementary school, robotics is offered as After-school Activities (ASAs) provided by external providers at ISB and may be included in units within the ES Design Curriculum. During summer and winter break, some external providers also host programs for VEX IQ or programming.&#x20;

Within middle school, extracurricular robotics teams ([ISB MS Robotics](isb-ms-robotics/)) are offered to students interested in working with the VEX IQ Robotics system and, in semester 1, participating in the VEX IQ Robotics Competition. Robotics-related topics are taught in certain MS design courses, such as the quarter-long Robotics and Coding electives or 3D modeling courses.

At the high school, the[ ISB HS Robotics Club](isb-hs-robotics-club/) is offered to interested HS students who are participating in the VEX V5 Robotics Competition or exploring independent robotics projects. Other clubs, such as the Machine Learning Research Club or Codelympians, are extracurricular HS clubs that focus on topics directly related to robotics. Robotics and robotics-related concepts are covered as units in many ISB HS Design courses, such as Engineering 9 & 10, with courses relating specifically to robotics being offered prior to 2020. Volunteering opportunities related to robotics are also available, such as the [HS Student Mentorship program](programs-and-initiatives/student-mentorship.md) and the [ISB Robotics Scrimmage](programs-and-initiatives/isb-robotics-scrimmage.md).&#x20;
