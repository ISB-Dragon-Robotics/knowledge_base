# ISB MS Robotics

ISB Middle School Robotics consists of student teams that explore robot design concepts through participation in competitions and in-class explorations.&#x20;

The club is supervised by MS Faculty Supervisors and ISB Design Staff with support from volunteers from the HS Robotics Club under the [Student Mentorship Program](../programs-and-initiatives/student-mentorship.md).&#x20;
