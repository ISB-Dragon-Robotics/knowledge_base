# History

The ISB HS Robotics Club, one of the oldest clubs at the International School of Beijing, began classroom and after-school activities in 2013 with the exploration of VEX Cortex and EDR systems. Student leadership of the HS Club began in roughly 2014 with elected club executives managing the administration of the club with club advisors as supervisors.&#x20;

The first record of VRC tournament participation by ISB HS Robotics teams is in the [ROBOTC Nothing But Net Tournament](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-16-4173.html#teams) in Xi'an with team numbers 32004A and 32004B, later switching to team number 91033A in the [Tianjin International Starstruck Competition](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-16-5042.html#teams). The current organization team number 86832 was first adopted in the \_\_ season with the creation of the current four teams of ISB Robotics: 86832A, 86832B, 86832C and 86832D.&#x20;

Although most students primarily stay within one of the four teams, teams are flexible and may switch teams between competition seasons under the guidance of club advisors and the executive team. When such information is available, the current and past members of each team are listed on the respective team pages of the site.

Before the creation of the ISB MS/HS Design Center, the HS Robotics Club was hosted in an EdTech classroom opposite the HS Office. In the 2020-2021 school year, after the construction of the design center, HS Robotics took place in the dedicated robotics area near the rear of the design center.&#x20;

At the start of the 2024-2025 V5RC High Stakes, season, there are 46 members within ISB High School Robotics.&#x20;
