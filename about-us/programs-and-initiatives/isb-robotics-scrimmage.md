# ISB Robotics Scrimmage

The ISB Robotics Scrimmage is an annually hosted tournament by the ISB HS Robotics Club during early to mid-season for international schools in the Beijing region and greater China to test designs before major tournaments at the end of the competition season. Schools participating in the ISB Robotics Scrimmage in 2023 include the International School of Beijing, Beijing City International School, Western Academy of Beijing, and the Boston International School (Wuxi). Before the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Tianjin International School also participated in scrimmages hosted by ISB.

The event is supervised by the club supervisors for ISB HS Robotics and consists of volunteers from ISB HS Robotics and the greater ISB community. For more information about past scrimmages, please click [here](../../docs-repo/isb-scrimmage-tournament-repository.md).
