# History

ISB MS Robotics was founded as an after-school activity (ASA) for Middle School students interested in learning about LEGO Mindstorm robotics, eventually progressing into MS competition teams participating in regional First Lego League tournaments in Beijing. The last FLL season that ISB teams participated in was in 2018, with the FLL teams shutting down near the end of 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the start of the 2023-2024 school season, the MS teams restarted under the purview of Ms. Tresohlavy and Mr. Garcia, switching to the VEX IQ system and participating in the VEX IQ Robotics Competition. In the first year of competition, four teams representing ISB MS Robotics participated in the IQ Robotics Tournament for international schools hosted by the Wuhan Yangtze International School (WYIS), with team 86832E winning the Design Award in the first year of participation.&#x20;
